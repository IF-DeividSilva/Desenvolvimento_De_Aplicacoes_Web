Lady Newton
Newton's laws of motion describe how objects move. The first law states that an object at rest stays at rest unless acted upon by an external force. 
The second law explains that force equals mass times acceleration. The third law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. 
These laws are fundamental in mechanics.

What is Newton's first law of motion?

Atom
Atoms form chemical bonds to create molecules. Covalent bonding occurs when atoms share electrons, while ionic bonding happens through the transfer of electrons between atoms.
These interactions define the properties of substances.
